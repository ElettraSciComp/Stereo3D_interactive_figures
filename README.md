# Stereo3D interactive figures
<div align="justify">  
Interactive 3D figures developed for manuscript: "Three-dimensional coherent diffraction snapshot imaging using extreme ultraviolet radiation from a free electron laser". Please note that the 3D interactive figures are in the .stl format and have been converted from Python 3D matrices (Numpy). In this conversion process a smoothing is also applied to images and therefore the final resulting interactive 3D figures may differ in appearence with respect to figures contained in the maunscript.
